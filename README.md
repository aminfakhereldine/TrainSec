# TrainSec

This project presents TrainSec, a simulation framework that facilitates security modeling and evaluation in networks of Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) systems. The framework simulates components and communications in CBTC networks according to [IEEE 1474.1](https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.2004.95746) the standard for CBTC performance and functional requirements. 



A scientific publication is [available](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43366-5_2) for TrainSec. If you find it useful in your research work, please consider citing as follows:
